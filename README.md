**Organization Name: Planned to A.T., Inc.**

https://www.plannedtoat.org/
Planned to A.T. was founded by two educators Ashley Rutland and Tiffany Pearson-Kilgore. We recognized a deficit
among our black male students in particular, who often dreamed of becoming professional athletes for financial gain
but lacked the knowledge and skills it took to successfully manage any type of income. We used 16+ years of
combined educational experience in collaboration with financial experts to create a game-style financial literacy
curriculum that starts students on a pathway to living successful and stable financial lives. Planned to A.T. launched
in September 2021, and has serviced over 2000 youth at both the K-12 and collegiate levels across the country. 91%
of participants surveyed began actively saving as a result of completing our program - some the first to save in the
families! We have expanded from only offering in-person workshops to offering autonomous curriculum packages
and hybrid model programs. Our demand has grown from word-of-mouth testimonials as students have shown
success in our programs, in addition to news laws around financial literacy education requirements and Name-Image-
Likeness. We currently have 30+ universities and youth groups on our growing waitlist in need of sponsorship.

**Project Description:**
Planned to A.T is in need of a data collection platform with the intent of collecting participating students' beginning,
middle, and ending progress as they participate in Planned to A.T.'s 3 financial literacy content sessions. The platform
will need to have the ability to have admin capabilities to categorize students by programming (school, organization,
etc.), dates of programming, and survey creation. Students would have the ability to upload data points like pictures/
screenshots. We want this web-based data collection platform to be mobile-friendly, so that it is easier for students
to complete forms during class sessions.

**Anticipated Features:**
• Data collection forms for pre, during, and post session
• Track each student progress by connecting their pre and post data forms
• The forms should be open to public for multiple sections and groups within each section (middle school, high
school, college, and pro)
• Dashboard reports for individuals, classes, school/group/institution, and overall data with filtering options
• Can download and export data in pdfs and excel
• PTAT staff (admin) login
• Admin can add and change questions on data input form and add new forms
• Admin can upload old data forms (airtable/google forms) into new form

**Technological Preferences:**
Open to any platform. We want the system to be hosted in Azure cloud service.
Potential Utility or Impact of Software:
The platform is intended to collect students' beginning, middle, and ending progress as they participate in Planned to
A.T.'s 3 content sessions. The platform's data will help PTAT determine students' attendance, financial progress
including habits implemented, and total savings to reward students through a tiered incentive program for meeting
their goals. It will also be used to see how many students did not have a savings account prior to starting the program.
Additionally, tracking if conversations are happening across generations.
